# Detecting Muscle Cocontraction Through Sliding Window Gaussian Processes
Code for project for graduate Machine Learning course.

my_gp.ipynb contains code for my own implementation of a Gaussian process. It is not as stable as the implementation provided by scikitlearn, 
which is what the sk_gp.ipynb is for.

sk_gp_3d.ipynb contains code for 3D Gaussian processes.
